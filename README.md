# Engineering DIY ESP32 Sensors & Cameras for Home Assistant

## Overview
This article documents the full journey of building DIY ESP32-based smart sensors and cameras for use with Home Assistant (HA). It combines 3D design, prototyping, wiring, firmware configuration, calibration, and final integration into a robust local-first smart home system. 

This project showcases a deep-dive into technical implementation, creativity, and troubleshooting, using affordable parts to create real, useful, and elegant devices â€” all documented with photos, videos, graphs, and YAML configs.

## 1. Motivation & Goals
Commercial devices are often overpriced, cloud-dependent, or offer limited flexibility. DIY devices, while more effort, offer ultimate control, better privacy, and an opportunity to truly learn the internals of smart home automation.

**Project Goals:**
- Build working sensors for temperature, humidity, COâ‚‚
- Design and print durable, aesthetic 3D cases
- Integrate into Home Assistant dashboards
- Tune and calibrate devices for accuracy
- Bonus: Build ESP32-based cameras with local RTSP streaming

---

## 2. Hardware
### Microcontroller:
- ESP32-S3 WROOM-1 Dev Board (Wi-Fi + USB-C)

### Sensors:
- SCD41 (COâ‚‚, Temp, Humid)
- DHT20 / AHT21 (Temperature & Humidity for simpler builds)

### Cameras:
- ESP32-CAM modules with OV2640

---

## 3. 3D Design in Autodesk Inventor
- **Version 1:** Initial print failed due to poor ventilation â†’ photos + lessons learned
- **Version 2:** Redesigned casing with better airflow, mounting slots, and compact layout
- 3D STL files available in repo

---

## 4. Assembly & Wiring
- Step-by-step wiring diagrams and photos
- Power: USB-C or screw terminal
- ESPHome YAML includes pin mappings and sensor config

---

## 5. YAML Configuration (ESPHome)
```yaml
esphome:
  name: esp32-sensor-co2
  platform: ESP32
  board: esp32dev

sensor:
  - platform: scd4x
    co2:
      name: "Living Room COâ‚‚"
    temperature:
      name: "Living Room Temperature"
    humidity:
      name: "Living Room Humidity"
    update_interval: 60s
```
Includes voltage sensor, uptime, signal strength, OTA configs, etc.

---

## 6. Calibration
- Compared readings with digital thermometers and hygrometers
- Measured offsets over time, applied linear/non-linear correction
- Used spreadsheet to graph real vs measured temperature â†’ correction factor derived

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: template
    name: "Corrected Temperature"
    lambda: |-
      return (x - 1.7);  # basic linear offset
```

---

## 7. Integration with Home Assistant
- Integrated via ESPHome native API
- Entity names standardized for clarity (e.g., `sensor.living_room_co2`)
- Used in:
  - Dashboard badges & cards
  - Alarm triggers
  - Automation for ventilation/humidification

---

## 8. UI & Dashboards
- Designed dashboards for **tablets** and **mobile phones** (portrait + landscape)
- Devices added to room views, gauge cards, graphs
- Bonus: COâ‚‚ LED alert on sensor body for quick glance
- Linked dashboard repo: [Home Assistant Dashboards](https://github.com/AlexeiakaTechnik/Practial-and-stylish-Home-Assistant-Dashboards-for-Tablets-and-Mobile-Phones)

---

## 9. Final Build & Use
- Final assembled sensors labeled with stickers: name, IP, MAC, function
- Mounted in various rooms with 3M backing or screws
- Monitored daily via HA and graphs

---

## 10. Bonus â€“ ESP32 Cameras
- ESP32-CAM modules set up with motion detection and streaming
- RTSP stream integrated into HA Lovelace dashboard
- Stored SD recordings (motion-based)
- Future improvements: add PIR sensor or IR LED for night vision

## Final Thoughts
This was an intense but rewarding project. I built something real, tangible, and useful for my smart home with the skills to replicate and expand it anytime. I hope it inspires others to build, improve, and learn. Reach out if you want to collaborate, or have questions!
